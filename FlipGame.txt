 You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

For example, given s = "++++", after one move, it may become one of the following states:

[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> generatePossibleNextMoves(string s) {
        vector<string> res;
        if(s.size() == 0) {
            return res;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; ++i) {
            if(s[i] == s[i+1]) {
                string tmp = s;
                if(s[i] == '+') {
                    tmp[i] = tmp[i+1] = '-';
                    res.push_back(tmp);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
